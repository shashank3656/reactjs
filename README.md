# Simple React.js Example

View a live version here: https://nyu-software-engineering.github.io/simple-react-example/

This simple React example shows:

- Components (a.k.a functions that return modular, reusable parts of the interface)
- `JSX` (a.k.a HTML-like syntax for creating interface elements)
- Event handlers (a.k.a functions you can run when the user clicks something, types something, or submits a form)
- Props (a.k.a. arguments to components)
- State variables
- Side-Effects (a.k.a. functions that can be run whenever a component first loads or anytime a State variable changes its value.)
- Using `axios` to make requests to servers.

## Install dependencies

`npm install`

## Start the React development server
